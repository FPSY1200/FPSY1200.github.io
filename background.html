            <h1>Who are you?</h1>
            <p>Hello, I am a simple programmer trying to begin their step into the professional field. I had a lot of good in my programming career thus far, from goofing off with the terminal to exposing myself with industry standard programs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Let's take a look at the my timeline together, shall we?</h3>
            <!-- To Do: create timeline -->
             <!-- To Do: Make these collapsable -->
            <br>
            <h4>2022</h4>
            <p>I first started learning about programming in my school's Computer Science Principles class. We mainly learned about networking, played with web design and even made prototype apps.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>2023</h4>
            <p> Became president of our high school's computer club, where we competed in competitions like Amazon Voice is Power and Lockheed Martin.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>2024</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, my technology teacher was unable to continue teaching in my senior year. Our school has dropped all technology courses after her departure.
            <br>Despite the lack of programming in school, our club still persists thanks to our computer-nerd digital media teacher Mr. Dennis. We focused on more hardware related things like:
            <ul>
                <li>Modding 3Ds</li>
                <li>Computer Tear-downs</li>
                <li>Introduction to Raspberry Pis</li>
            </ul>
            I also started to focus on personal side projects such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Making my first Roblox Project</li>
                <li>Remaking my old text adventure game using RenPy</li>
                <li>Working towards certifications like CS50x Intro to Computer Science</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Present</h4>
            <p>After graduating on top of my class, I started the next school year at University of Central Florida. I am currently majoring in Computer Science B.S., enrolled in their undergraduate research program and already spoken to </p>
